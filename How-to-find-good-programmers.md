In general there are a few guiding principals to follow

1) You cannot afford to hire the 80% of developers that offer cut prices, as they are the 80% that are not as good. 

2) You want a developer who wants to understand your needs and suggest ways to satisfy them, rather than one who wants to meet the requirements on the spec sheet. 

3) In general it is better to pay by the hour than by project. 

4) You want someone who knows multiple languages and not just one. 

5) A few questions to ask are 
	
	What version control system do you use ?
	How do you do unit testing ?
	What frameworks do you use ?

	The specific answers do not matter, rather the attitude and knowledge in each of these categories reflect the capability of the programmer.
